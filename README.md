# Tic-Tac-Game
This is a simple implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game using Pygame. The game allows a user to play against an AI.

## Features
- Play as X or O
- AI opponent using Minimax algorithm
- Game state management (win, lose, tie)
- Restart functionality

## How AI Works
The AI employs the Minimax algorithm to make optimal decisions based on the current board state. It evaluates potential moves and chooses the one that maximizes its chances of winning while minimizing the user's chances.

### Game Flow
1. User selects to play as X or O.
2. The game alternates turns between the user and the AI.
3. The AI evaluates possible moves and executes the best one.
4. The game continues until there is a win or a tie.

## Issues
- AI may be challenging to beat due to its optimal play. Consider implementing difficulty levels for more engaging gameplay.
